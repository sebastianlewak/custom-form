# Manual Testing Portfolio - Registration Form Project

This project demonstrates my skills in manual testing, frontend development with Next.js, styling with Tailwind CSS, and basic MySQL database management. The core of this project is a user registration form that allows users to input their details, which are then stored in a MySQL database.


## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the form.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system to store form data.
- **DBeaver**: A database management tool used for viewing and managing data in the MySQL database.
- **Git**: Version control system to manage the source code.
